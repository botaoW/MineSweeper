MineSweeper
====

MineSweeper is a practising app for Java learners who are at beginning level.

This repository does NOT provide a fully funtional app. Instead, it gives codes which are core to the app.

This app is a good practice. It uses essential functions for building Java apps, such as radiogroup (for button selecting), alpha (for animation) and intent(for passing data between classes).

Suggested developing tool:   Android Studio
You can download it for free. URL:

Note:
```java
DO NOT use these codes without permission.
Please contact me and ask for permission if you want to use the code. 
Thank you.
