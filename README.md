MineSweeper
====

MineSweeper is a practising app for Java learners who are at beginning level.

This repository does NOT provide a fully funtional app. Instead, it gives codes which are core to the app.

This app is a good practice. It uses essential functions for building Java apps, such as radiogroup (for button selecting), alpha (for animation) and intent(for passing data between classes).

# Suggested developing tool:
