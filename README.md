This is a small prctising app for some java new learners whos is at their beginning level.

This repository doesn't provide any full-funtional app. Instead, it provides codes which are core to the app.

It is a good practice since it used things like radiogroup, alpha and intent. All of these are very important to build a java app.

Note:
```java
It is not OK to use my code without any permission.
If you want to use, please contact me first.
