MineSweeper
====

MineSweeper is a small practising app for Java learners who are at beginning level.

This repository does NOT provide any fully funtional app. Instead, it gives codes which are core to the app.

This app could be a good practice. It uses essential functions for building Java apps, such as radiogroup (for button selecting), alpha (for animation) and intent(for passing data between classes).

Note:
```java
DO NOT use these codes without permission.
Please contact me and ask for permission if you want to use the code. 
Thank you.
```
